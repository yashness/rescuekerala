# Kerala Rescue

Website for coordinating rehabilitation of people affected in the 2018 Kerala Floods.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have following softwares in your system:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing

#### Setting up a development environment

1. Create database and user in postgres for kerala rescue and give privileges.

```
psql user=postgres
Password:
psql (10.4 (Ubuntu 10.4-0ubuntu0.18.04))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE rescuekerala;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER rescueuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rescuekerala TO rescueuser;
GRANT
postgres=# \q

```

2. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/IEEEKeralaSection/rescuekerala.git
cd rescuekerala
```

3. Copy the sample environment file and configure it as per your local settings.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: If you cannot copy the environment or you're facing any difficulty in starting the server, copy the settings file from
https://github.com/vigneshhari/keralarescue_test_settings for local testing.

3. Install dependencies.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run database migrations.

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

5. Setup static files.
```
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```


6. Run the server.

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
7. Now open localhost:8000 in the browser

## Running tests

When running tests, Django creates a test replica of the database in order for the tests not to change the data on the real database. Because of that you need to alter the Postgres user that you created and add to it the `CREATEDB` priviledge:

```
ALTER USER rescueuser CREATEDB;
```

To run the tests, run this command:

```
python3 manage.py test --settings=floodrelief.test_settings
```

### Enable HTTPS connections

Certain features (example: GPS location collection) only work with HTTPS connections.  To enable HTTPS connections follow the below steps.

Create self-signed certicate with openssl

```
$openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.key -out certificate.crt -days 365 -subj '/CN=localhost' -nodes
```
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl#10176685]

Install django-sslserver

```
$pip3 install django-sslserver
```

Update INSTALLED_APPS with sslserver by editing the file floodrelief/settings.py (diff below)

```
 INSTALLED_APPS = [
+    'sslserver',
     'mainapp.apps.MainappConfig',
     'django.contrib.admin',
```
#### Note: Make sure that this change is removed before pushing your changes back to git
Run the server

```
python3 manage.py runsslserver 10.0.0.131:8002  --certificate /path/to/certificate.crt --key /path/to/key.key
```
In the above example the server is being run on a local IP address on port 8002 to enable HTTPS access from mobile/laptop/desktop for testing.
